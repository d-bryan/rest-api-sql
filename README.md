
# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree v2 - REST API Project

## Overview of the Provided Project Files

We've supplied the following files for you to use: 

* The `seed` folder contains a starting set of data for your database in the form of a JSON file (`data.json`) and a collection of files (`context.js`, `database.js`, and `index.js`) that can be used to create your app's database and populate it with data (we'll explain how to do that below).
* We've included a `.gitignore` file to ensure that the `node_modules` folder doesn't get pushed to your GitHub repo.
* The `app.js` file configures Express to serve a simple REST API. We've also configured the `morgan` npm package to log HTTP requests/responses to the console. You'll update this file with the routes for the API. You'll update this file with the routes for the API.
* The `nodemon.js` file configures the nodemon Node.js module, which we are using to run your REST API.
* The `package.json` file (and the associated `package-lock.json` file) contain the project's npm configuration, which includes the project's dependencies.
* The `RESTAPI.postman_collection.json` file is a collection of Postman requests that you can use to test and explore your REST API.

## Getting Started

To get up and running with this project, run the following commands from the root of the folder that contains this README file.

First, install the project's dependencies using `npm`.

```
npm install

```

Second, seed the SQLite database.

```
npm run seed
```

And lastly, start the application.

```
npm start
```

To test the Express server, browse to the URL [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/).

## Grading Requirements

Goal: Exceeds Expectations

## Database Connection

### Meets Expectations

Sequelize is listed as a dependency in the package.json file
Sequelize is configured to use the fsjstd-restapi.db SQLite database that's generated by the npm run seed command
A message is written to the console when thereâ€™s an error connecting to the database
A message is written to the console when the database connection is successfully opened

## User Model

### Meets Expectations

The user schema follows the provided specification:
id (Integer, primary key, auto-generated)
firstName (String)
lastName (String)
emailAddress (String)
password (String)

## Course Model

### Meets Expectations

The course schema follows the provided specification:
id (Integer, primary key, auto-generated)
userId (id from the Users table)
title (String)
description (Text)
estimatedTime (String, nullable)
materialsNeeded (String, nullable)

## Model Associations

### Meets Expectations

A HasMany association is defined between the User and Course models
A BelongsTo association is defined between the Course and User models

## User Routes

### Meets Expectations

All of the following user routes are available and return the following data as specified:
GET /api/users 200 - Returns the currently authenticated user
POST /api/users 201 - Creates a user, sets the Location header to "/", and returns no content

### Exceeds Expectations

The GET /api/users route filters out the following properties:
password
createdAt
updatedAt

## Course Routes

### Meets Expectations

All of the following course routes are available and return the following data as specified:
GET /api/courses 200 - Returns a list of courses (including the user that owns each course)
GET /api/courses/:id 200 - Returns a the course (including the user that owns the course) for the provided course ID
POST /api/courses 201 - Creates a course, sets the Location header to the URI for the course, and returns no content
PUT /api/courses/:id 204 - Updates a course and returns no content
DELETE /api/courses/:id 204 - Deletes a course and returns no content

### Exceeds Expectations

The GET /api/courses and /api/courses/:id routes filter out the following properties:
createdAt

updatedAt

The PUT /api/courses/:id and DELETE /api/courses/:id routes return a 403 status code if the current user doesn't own the requested course

## Validations

### Meets Expectations

The POST and PUT routes validate if the request body contains the following required values:
User
    firstName
    lastName
    emailAddress
    password

Course
    title
    description

Validation error(s) are sent with a400 status code

### Exceeds Expectations

The POST /api/users route validates that the provided email address is a valid email address and isn't already associated with an existing user

## Password Security

### Meets Expectations

The POST /api/users route hashes the user's password before persisting the user to the database

## Permissions

### Meets Expectations

An Express middleware function authenticates the following routes:
GET /api/users
POST /api/courses
PUT /api/courses/:id

DELETE /api/courses/:id

When authentication fails a 401 status code is returned
